> **Share Craft Wisdom. Build Community. Preserve Traditions.**

SnapCraft revolutionizes how craftsmen share knowledge by combining ephemeral social features with RAG-powered AI that understands traditional techniques, materials, and the cultural context of craft traditions. Unlike generic social platforms, SnapCraft treats craft content with the depth and respect it deserves.

🎉 **Latest Update**: Complete platform overhaul with AI scoring, onboarding system, achievements, and enhanced Profile experience (June 29, 2025)

## 🎯 **The Vision: Social Media That Builds Rather Than Destroys**

### **The Problem with Current Platforms**
- **Surface-Level Understanding**: Platforms treat craft content as generic media, missing technical depth
- **Tool Frustration**: Users see projects requiring equipment they don't own, leading to abandonment  
- **Knowledge Fragmentation**: Traditional craft knowledge scattered without contextual connections
- **Attention Destruction**: Quick dopamine hits prevent deep skill development
- **Monetization Barriers**: Skilled craftsmen struggle to build sustainable businesses

### **The SnapCraft Solution**
**SpikeyPOV**: SnapCraft pushes back against the consensus that Artisans and Craftsmen are obsolete in the age of mass production, by providing a platform for Artisans and Craftsmen to not only showcase, advertise, and sell their custom, made-to-order specialty pieces of craftsmanship, but also allows them to supplement their income through social media views.

SnapCraft leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to create the first social platform that:
- ✨ **Understands Craft Context**: AI that recognizes techniques, materials, and cultural significance
- 🔧 **Matches Tools & Skills**: Personalized content based on your equipment and skill level  
- 🌍 **Connects Traditions**: Links techniques across different craft cultures and time periods
- 📚 **Builds Attention Spans**: Process-focused content that rewards patience and deep learning
- 💰 **Enables Creator Economy**: Direct monetization for traditional craftsmen and artisans
