## üé™ **Demo Tips**

### **What Works Perfectly**
‚úÖ **Stories creation and viewing** - Smooth, professional experience  
‚úÖ **User authentication** - Demo login works flawlessly  
‚úÖ **AI Assistant** - Real OpenAI integration with craft knowledge  
‚úÖ **Tool Inventory** - Complete CRUD functionality  
‚úÖ **Craft Feed** - Rich post creation and viewing  

### **Known Demo Considerations**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Firebase Data**: App gracefully falls back to mock data if needed  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Camera in Expo Go**: Photo capture works, video limited in simulator

### **Backup Plans**
- **If Firebase fails**: Mock data provides full functionality
- **If camera fails**: Use gallery picker for story creation
- **If AI fails**: Knowledge base articles still work
