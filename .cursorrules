You are an expert in TypeScript, React Native, Expo, Firebase, and Mobile UI development with RAG integration.

Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Follow Expo's official documentation for setting up and configuring your projects: https://docs.expo.dev/

Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.
- Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., CraftPost, ToolInventory).
- Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., isFetchingCrafts, handleRAGGeneration).

TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Use strict mode in TypeScript for better type safety.
- Define proper types for Firebase data models and RAG responses.

Syntax and Formatting
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.
- Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.

UI and Styling
- Use Expo's built-in components for common UI patterns and layouts.
- Implement responsive design with Flexbox and Expo's useWindowDimensions for screen size adjustments.
- Use styled-components or NativeWind for component styling with craft-themed design.
- Implement dark mode support using Expo's useColorScheme.
- Ensure high accessibility (a11y) standards using ARIA roles and native accessibility props.
- Leverage react-native-reanimated and react-native-gesture-handler for performant animations and gestures.
- Design with craftsman aesthetics: earth tones, wood textures, authentic materials representation.

Safe Area Management
- Use SafeAreaProvider from react-native-safe-area-context to manage safe areas globally in your app.
- Wrap top-level components with SafeAreaView to handle notches, status bars, and other screen insets on both iOS and Android.
- Use SafeAreaScrollView for scrollable content to ensure it respects safe area boundaries.
- Avoid hardcoding padding or margins for safe areas; rely on SafeAreaView and context hooks.

Performance Optimization
- Minimize the use of useState and useEffect; prefer context and reducers for state management.
- Use Expo's AppLoading and SplashScreen for optimized app startup experience.
- Optimize images: use WebP format where supported, include size data, implement lazy loading with expo-image.
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading for non-critical components with React's Suspense and dynamic imports.
- Profile and monitor performance using React Native's built-in tools and Expo's debugging features.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by memoizing components and using useMemo and useCallback hooks appropriately.
- Optimize RAG processing with proper caching and debouncing.

Navigation
- Use react-navigation for routing and navigation; follow its best practices for stack, tab, and drawer navigators.
- Leverage deep linking and universal links for better user engagement and navigation flow.
- Use dynamic routes with expo-router for better navigation handling.
- Implement craft-specific navigation patterns (e.g., technique discovery, project timeline).

State Management
- Use Zustand for global state management as specified in the architecture.
- Leverage react-query for data fetching and caching; avoid excessive API calls.
- Handle URL search parameters using libraries like expo-linking.
- Implement proper state management for user tool inventory and skill progression.

Firebase Integration
- Use Firebase Auth with custom claims for authentication.
- Implement Firestore for user data, content metadata, and craft knowledge storage.
- Use Firebase Storage for media files (photos, videos of craft processes).
- Implement Cloud Functions for RAG processing pipeline.
- Follow Firebase security rules best practices for craft content and user data.
- Use Firebase Analytics to track craft learning progression and content engagement.

RAG Implementation
- Integrate OpenAI GPT-4 API for intelligent content generation.
- Implement Pinecone vector database for semantic search of craft knowledge.
- Create proper error handling for RAG API calls with fallback content.
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed craft knowledge.
- Use proper typing for RAG responses and knowledge base queries.
- Implement context-aware content generation based on user's craft specialization.

Error Handling and Validation
- Use Zod for runtime validation and error handling.
- Implement proper error logging using Sentry or a similar service.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
  - Handle errors at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
  - Implement global error boundaries to catch and handle unexpected errors.
- Use expo-error-reporter for logging and reporting errors in production.
- Handle RAG API failures gracefully with user-friendly messages.

Testing
- Write unit tests using Jest and React Native Testing Library.
- Implement integration tests for critical user flows using Detox.
- Use Expo's testing tools for running tests in different environments.
- Consider snapshot testing for components to ensure UI consistency.
- Test RAG integration with mock responses for reliable testing.

Security
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks.
- Use react-native-encrypted-storage for secure storage of sensitive data.
- Ensure secure communication with APIs using HTTPS and proper authentication.
- Use Expo's Security guidelines to protect your app: https://docs.expo.dev/guides/security/
- Implement proper API key management for OpenAI and Pinecone.
- Secure user-generated craft content and personal tool inventory data.

Camera and Media Handling
- Use Expo Camera API for craft process documentation.
- Implement Expo AV for video processing and timelapse creation.
- Optimize media handling for craft documentation (before/after shots, process videos).
- Implement proper permissions handling for camera and media library access.
- Use expo-image-picker for gallery selection with craft-specific filtering.

Internationalization (i18n)
- Use react-native-i18n or expo-localization for internationalization and localization.
- Support multiple languages and RTL layouts.
- Ensure text scaling and font adjustments for accessibility.
- Consider regional craft terminology and cultural variations.

Key Conventions for SnapCraft
1. Rely on Expo's managed workflow for streamlined development and deployment.
2. Prioritize Mobile Web Vitals (Load Time, Jank, and Responsiveness).
3. Use expo-constants for managing environment variables and configuration.
4. Use expo-permissions to handle device permissions gracefully.
5. Implement expo-updates for over-the-air (OTA) updates.
6. Follow Expo's best practices for app deployment and publishing: https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/introduction/
7. Ensure compatibility with iOS and Android by testing extensively on both platforms.
8. Implement craft-specific features like tool inventory management and skill progression tracking.
9. Design for process-focused content creation and documentation.
10. Prioritize authentic craft community values and traditional knowledge preservation.

Educational Approach for New Mobile Developers
- Provide comprehensive explanations including what, why, and how for each implementation
- Explain mobile-specific concepts that differ from web development (bridge architecture, native modules, platform differences)
- Include trade-offs and alternative approaches when relevant
- Add learning callouts using ðŸ“š MOBILE CONCEPT: format for key mobile development concepts
- Recognize learning questions marked with ðŸŽ“ LEARNING QUESTION: and provide detailed educational responses
- Always explain the mobile development context and patterns being used
- Break down complex mobile concepts into digestible explanations
- Reference official documentation and best practices for deeper learning
